Analyzing the Dataset

In December 2019, scientists discovered a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) associated with a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, suspected to be zoonotic in origin. In a split second, what non-specialists thought to be a benign situation was declared a pandemic after ravaging the lives of so many globally. The only way to get a more unobstructed view of the current situation was sorting for datasets about the virus in my location. I stumbled on this link https://www.kaggle.com/roche-data-science-coalition/uncover, and I used a bash script to analyze the datasets. The datasets is just about 1.4GB in size, and it is in different categories. I only chose a teeny tiny bit.

Dataset Description

This dataset is composed of a curated collection of over 200 publicly available COVID-19 related datasets from sources like Johns Hopkins, the WHO, the World Bank, the New York Times, and many others. It includes data on a wide variety of potentially powerful statistics and indicators, like local and national infection rates, global social distancing policies, geospatial data on the movement of people, and more (https://www.kaggle.com/roche-data-science-coalition/uncover).
